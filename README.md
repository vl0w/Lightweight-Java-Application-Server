Read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vl0w/Lightweight-Java-Application-Server/wiki/Getting-Started) document if you want to start writing applications for LJAS.

## Overview

LJAS is a small Java application server.

It was created back in 2010 for an educational project which was a little chat application like IRC, realized
by two developer trainees from Switzerland.  
As we designed the architecture, the project was strictly separated in the server engine
and the actual chat application code.   
For the sake of education, we didn't want to use existing JEE application servers as JBoss or Glassfish.
