# Lightweight Java Application Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vl0w/Lightweight-Java-Application-Server.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/vl0w/Lightweight-Java-Application-Server)

Have a look at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/vl0w/Lightweight-Java-Application-Server/wiki/Roadmap) for upcoming releases
and the [Release Notes](https://github.com/vl0w/Lightweight-Java-Application-Server/wiki/Release-Notes) for past versions.

## Overview

LJAS is a small Java application server.

It was created back in 2010 for an educational project which was a little chat application like IRC, realized
by two developer trainees from Switzerland.  
As we designed the architecture, the project was strictly separated in the server engine
and the actual chat application code.   
For the sake of education, we didn't want to use existing JEE application servers as JBoss or Glassfish.

## Who should use it?

When you've read the previous paragraph, you've probably noticed that this project is neither purposed for
professional applications nor can it be compared to a real Java EE application server like JBoss or Glassfish. 
It has its own *specifications* and code styles.

Nevertheless, it might be a cool application server for small projects and people who are interested in light
client-server architecture in Java.
