        <h1>Lightweight Java Application Server</h1>

<p>LJAS is a small socket / thread-per-client Java application server.</p>

<p>It was created back in 2010 for an educational project which was a little chat application like IRC, realized
by two developer trainees from Switzerland.<br>
As we designed the architecture, the project was strictly separated in the server engine
and the actual chat application code.<br>
For the sake of education, we didn't want to use existing JEE application servers as JBoss or Glassfish.</p>

<h2>Who should use it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>People which are interested in building small client-server based applications in Java</li>
<li>People which are <strong>not</strong> interested in J2EE</li>
<li>People which are interested in simple client-server architecture in Java</li>
</ul>
